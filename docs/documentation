- All the images required in the project must resides inside the asset folder (src/assets).


                            # ROUTEING

 Define all the routes under navigation.constant.tsx under models/constants (increase readability) and map it in the navigation.tsx, this is for
 dynamic routing and will reduce the file size and line of code (LOC).

 Use the Link of react-router-dom to navigate in specific page provided that path and element props must be present.

                            # FOLDER STRUCTURE

 Folder structure is clearly explained in the react convention ( https://github.com/selisebt/frontend-conventions/tree/main/react-conventions).
 All the pages that are to be seen in the screen is defined inside the pages folder and the components required in the page should define under
 components folder.

                             # WORKING

 - How project get executes?
 When the project starts, first of all, it executes the index.tsx file and followed by App.tsx and navigation.tsx where
 all the routes are mapped. We have called header (<Header />) from navigation to keep the same header (nav bar) for all the pages.

 - How the logic under counter.tsx works?
